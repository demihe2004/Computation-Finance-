# Computation-Finance-
This repository contains 9 python projects from computation finance course focusing on quantitative and computational tools used in finance, including numerical techniques such as implementation of binomial and trinomial option pricing, lattice algorithms for computing derivative prices and hedge ratios, simulation-based algorithms for pricing American options, and numerical solution of partial differential equations that appear in financial engineering.
